# Messenger (demo)

ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤£ I am working on chat application where user can easy communicate with client or friends. They can easily create the groups and share the files with each other. Clean and simple design at the same time User friendly also.

Developed example inspired by the design [Messenger mobile app](https://dribbble.com/shots/16038165-Messenger-mobile-app?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Lokanaka&utm_content=Messenger%20mobile%20app&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Lokanaka&utm_content=Messenger%20mobile%20app&utm_medium=Social_Share) by [Lokanaka](https://dribbble.com/Lokanaka). I take this opportunity to congratulate Lokanaka for the excellent work.

## SOLID Principles
The development of the project was carried out based on the principles of single responsibility of high cohesion and low coupling, collected as SOLID principles of software engineering. 

## Architecture
Designed in a multilayer architecture, which constitutes an object-oriented system organized in several layers or levels. Each of these layers or levels contains a set of classes with responsibilities related to the layer to which they belong.  

## Architecture pattern
To take advantage of these advantages, I have relied on the SwiftUI language for the implementation of the presentation layer, as well as the architecture pattern: **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** that allowed me to exploit its full potential.
